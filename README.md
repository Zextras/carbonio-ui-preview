### Usage

Install the package
```shell
npm i @zextras/carbonio-ui-preview
```

Wrap your app with the `PreviewManager` and the `ThemeProvider`

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@zextras/carbonio-design-system";
import { PreviewManager } from "@zextras/carbonio-ui-preview";

// ...

<ThemeProvider>
  <PreviewManager>
    <App/>
  </PreviewManager>
</ThemeProvider>
```

Init the preview from within your app

```tsx
import { usePreview } from "@zextras/carbonio-ui-preview";

// ...

const { initPreview } = usePreview();

initPreview([
  {
    previewType: 'image',
    id: 'id1',
    src: '...'
  },
  {
    previewType: 'pdf',
    id: 'id2',
    src: '...'
  },
  // ...
]);
```

And open the preview of an initialized item through its id

```tsx
import { usePreview } from "@zextras/carbonio-ui-preview";

// ...

const { openPreview } = usePreview();

openPreview(id);
```
